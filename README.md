# meta-rdk-app-appsdkexamples-simple
meta-layer for some examples apps that are listed in new App SDK (DAC2.0) under "rdkm" org, see https://github.com/stagingrdkm/rdke-appsdk-manifests/tree/develop/app/0_rdkm  
Purpose: Enables developers to quickly learn the App SDK through hands-on example apps, complete with recipes and metadata, and easily replicate the build process for their own projects.  
Fully representative App run test requires RDK7+/8 version with AppInfra2 Middleware (AI2.0).  
Run test on RDK7 box with DAC1.0 is possible when you manipulate and combine both this app-layer and base-layer into 1 single oci-image / bundle.   
DAC1.0 SDK example apps: see https://github.com/rdkcentral/meta-dac-sdk/tree/develop/recipes-example/images
